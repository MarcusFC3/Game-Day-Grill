            <h2>What Makes Us Special?</h2>
            The Game Day Grill is a sports restaurant that seeks to unite sports fans of all
            varieties. Sports contain a level of competition and excitement that cannot be
            found in anything else, and we understand how truly special that is.
            That is why we have decided to create the ultimate sport's viewing hub
            and restaurant, as we feel it is our civic duty to provide our community with
            the highest quality sports entertainment experience so people can enjoy
            sports at a heightened level for an affordable price that would otherwise be
            unattainable for the average person. 
            <h2>Plans For The Future</h2>
            The Game Day Grill plans to one day become a household name in the United States and
            will begin its expansion after finding local success in the city of Defiance.
            <h2>Thank You</h2>
            As a resturant just getting their feet set in the industry, Game Day Grill 
            has some high hopes for its future. Everything has its start and everyone on the Game Day Grill team 
            would like to send their deepest level of gratitude towards anyone who has supported us in 
            our mission to improve our quality and extend our services across the United States. None of this would
            be possible without our loyal customers and exemplary team of staff.
